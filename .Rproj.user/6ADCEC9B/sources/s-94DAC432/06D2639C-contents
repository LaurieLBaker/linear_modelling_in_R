- Rmarkdown provides a reproducible record of your work
- It is a .Rmd (the md stands for markdown) file that contains the text and code to repeat your work. 
- It interacts with pandocs to produce dynamic documents. By dynamic we mean that the documents can take on different formats: html, pdf, word.

Answer:

Some of the things that could be improved.
- The date is incorrect, 
- There is a lot of R code that is shown that shouldn't be included in a professional publication. 
- Overall it looks a bit messy.

# Country Report

* Plots the average life expectancy between 1980 and 2010 for a country. 


```{r lifeExp-plot, echo = FALSE}


ggplot() +
  geom_line(
    data = gapminder_sub,
    aes(
      x = year,
      y = lifeExp,
      group = country,
      color = continent
    ),
    alpha = 0.2,
    lwd = 0.75
  ) +
  geom_line(
    data = gapminder_country,
    aes(x = year,
        y = lifeExp,
        color = continent
    ),
    lwd = 2
    ) +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = paste(
      "Life Expectancy over time in",
      params$country,
      "from 1980 to 2010",
      sep = " "
    ),
    color = "Continent"
  ) +
  geom_label(
    data = gapminder_country %>%
      slice(which.min(year)),
    aes(
      x = year, 
      y = lifeExp, 
      label = country
    ),
    nudge_x = 2,
    nudge_y = -2.5
  )

```

???

In their report Agnes and Teteh produce a plot of average life expectancy for each country colour coded by continent. In their plot they highlight the country of interest, in this case Colombia. 

---

# Country Report

* Creates a table of the mean life expectancy by country.

```{r table, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

lifeExp_country %>% 
  kable(booktabs = T,
        caption = "Mean Life Expectancy in the Americas") %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  row_spec(which(lifeExp_country$country == params$country), bold = T, color = "white", background = "blue")

```

???

They also create a table of the mean life expectancy by country.

# R Markdown anatomy

### 1. YAML header (aka metadata)

### 2. Narrative (our text)

### 3. Code Chunks (our code/plots)


???

The anatomy of an R Markdown document consists of the YAML header, where we have our metadata.

The narrative, or the text of our document.

And the code chunks to create our code and plots. 

---

# YAML 

- A typical header contains basic metadata (e.g. `title`, `author`, `date`).

```yaml
---
*title: Reproducible Country Report
*author: Agnes and Teteh
*date: 30/07/2020
output: html_document
---
```
???

A typical YAML header contains basic metadata including the title, author, and date of the report. 


Optional information to share: 
- YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization language. 
- It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. 
- Like other data serialization languages (e.g. XML and JSON), it provides a standard format to transfer data that applications with different technologies and languages with different data structures can use. 

---
# YAML

* And rendering instructions (`output: html_document`) used by pandocs.

```yaml
---
title: Reproducible Country Report
author: Agnes and Teteh
date: 30/07/2020
*output: html_document
---
```

???

The YAML header also contains rendering instructions that is used by pandocs. 

For the audience: Any guess what type of document we are creating from the output specified?

---

# YAML

* Within output there are extra options, (e.g. `theme`, `highlight`, etc):

```yaml
---
title: Reproducible Country Report
author: Agnes and Teteh
date: 30/07/2020
output: 
  html_document:
*    theme: cosmo
*    highlight: haddock
*    number_sections: TRUE
---
```
--
* Note that the options are nested under what they change using indents.

???

Within output we can specific extra options including the theme, highlight, etc. 

Notice here that these extra options are indented. They are nested under what they change. The theme, highlight, and number_sections are things that modify the html document.

If you aren't getting what you expected, check the indentation, it could be that you've forgotten to indent. 

---

# YAML and Parameters

* You can also specify parameters `params` to change the content of your document.

```yaml
---
title: Reproducible Country Report
author: Agnes and Teteh
date: 30/07/2020
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: cosmo
    highlight: haddock
    number_sections: TRUE
*params:
*  country: Colombia
---
```
--

* More on parameters later!

???

You can also specify parameters 'params' to change the content of your document.

Here Teteh and Agnes have specified the country Colombia. We'll cover parameters in greater depth later in the course.

    number_sections: TRUE
*   ? 
params:
  country: Colombia
---
```
1. Run `?rmarkdown::html_document` in your R console to find out what you can change.

2. What does `toc` and `highlight` do? 

3. Try changing the `theme` and adding a `toc` then rerun the document.

`r countdown(minutes = 6, seconds = 00)` 

???

Let's explore the YAML header further. 

1. Run `?rmarkdown::html_document` in your R console to find out what you can change.

2. What does `toc` and `highlight` do? 

3. Try changing the `theme` and adding a `toc` then rerun the document.

Answers:

2. If we set toc: TRUE this will include a table of contents in the output;
highlight will change the syntax highlighting style.

3. Changing the theme will change the visual theme, students can reflect on which one they like most and which they think looks best for Agnes and Teteh's professional report. 

By adding the toc, students will see that the document now has a table of contents which you can click on to go to different parts of the document.

To write our narrative we will use the markdown language. 

Included in the slide are some of the main things you will want to know to style your text and add sections.

You use hashes '#' for the section headers. Asterisks '*' to bold and italize text and you can also add hyperlinks using square brackets '[ ]' and parentheses '( )'. 

---

# Your Turn

Using the links below add the section **"About the data"** to the document.

* gapminder: http://www.gapminder.org/data/

* gapminder package: https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder



### About the data

The data comes from the [gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/data/) dataset from the [`gapminder` package](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder) by Jenny Bryan.

`r countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 00)`

The code chunk also consists of a chunk header that specifies

- the language engine, in this case 'r' for R code
- an optional label. The label we've used in this cases is Libraries because we are loading in the libraries. 
- and the chunk option, in this case 'echo = FALSE' which means the code will not be included. But more on chunk options later.

# Chunk options

* **Chunk options** are used to customise the behaviour and output of the code chunks.

--

### Code

* `echo` - Display code in output document (default = TRUE)
* `eval` - Run code in chunk (default = TRUE)
* `message` - display code messages in document (default = TRUE)
* `warning` - display code warnings in document (default = TRUE)

--

### Figures

* `fig.align` - 'left', 'right', or 'center' (default = 'default')
* `fig.cap` - figure caption as character string (default = NULL)
* `fig.height, fig.width` - Dimensions of plots in inches

???

Chunk options are used to customize the behaviour and output of the code chunks. 

There are different options for the code:

* `echo` - Display code in output document (default = TRUE)
* `eval` - Run code in chunk (default = TRUE)
* `message` - display code messages in document (default = TRUE)
* `warning` - display code warnings in document (default = TRUE)

There are also different things that we can adjust within the figures

* `fig.align` - 'left', 'right', or 'center' (default = 'default')
* `fig.cap` - figure caption as character string (default = NULL)
* `fig.height, fig.width` - Dimensions of plots in inches

---
# Global and local chunk options

* Chunk options can be set locally (chunk by chunk).

--

* Or globally. 


````md
```{r setup, include = FALSE}`r ''`

*knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE)

```

````
???

Chunk options can be set locally on a chunk by chunk basis.


Or chunk options can be set globally, i.e. for the whole document. This is done using knitr::opts_chunk$set() and specifying the global chunk options you want to set for the whole document. 

---

# Your Turn

Use the following code chunk options to tidy up the report. 


* `echo` - Display code in output document (default = TRUE)
* `eval` - Run code in chunk (default = TRUE)
* `message` - display code messages in document (default = TRUE)
* `warning` - display code warnings in document (default = TRUE)
* `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE)` - globally

--

If you have time, try playing with the figure options.

* `fig.align` - 'left', 'right', or 'center' (default = 'default')
* `fig.cap` - figure caption as character string (default = NULL)
* `fig.height, fig.width` - Dimensions of plots in inches


`r countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 00)` 
 
--

* We're now in line with `Country_Report_Step1_2.Rmd`

???

Let's help Agnes and Teteh clean up their report.

Try changing the chunk options locally (chunk by chunk) or globally.

If you have time, try playing with teh figure options. 


---

# Inline R code

* Inline R code is embedded in the text using the syntax *'r '*.

* You can refer to a variable by name (e.g. `average_lifeExp`) in the inline r code after the chunk where it is calculated.

--

### Reporting the average life expectancy

````md
```{r average_lifeExp_calc}`r ''`

average_lifeExp <- gapminder_country %>%
  summarise(average_lifeExp = round(mean(lifeExp), 2))

```
````

The average life expectancy in Colombia between 1980 and 2010 was *'r average_lifeExp'* becomes


The average life expectancy in `r params$country` between 1980 and 2010 was `r average_lifeExp`.

???

We can embed inline R code using an opening and closing back tick. We can then refer to a variable name (e.g. average_lifeExp) using inline r code to get that value to appear in the text.

---

# Your Turn

### Reporting maximum and minimum life expectancy

* Add two new code chunks to calculate the minimum and maximum life expectancy.
* Reference the new values in two sentences.
  * The minimum life expectancy in Colombia between 1980 and 2010 was ____.
  * The maximum life expectancy in Colombia between 1980 and 2010 was ____.

* Hint: in R you'll need the functions `max()` and `min()`

`r countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 00)` 
 
???

Add two new code chunks calculating the minimum and maximum life expectancy and reference these values in two new sentences in the text.

Hint: you'll need to use the functions max() and min(). 

Futher hint: follow the example where the average life expectancy is calculated.

Answer: 

Step 1 is to calculate the new values

```{r min_lifeExp_calc}

min_lifeExp <- gapminder_country %>%
  summarise(min_lifeExp = round(min(lifeExp), 2))

```

And then refer to the new variable name in the text: `r min_lifeExp`. 

---
# Parameters revisited

**Parameters** allow you to reuse your document with new inputs (e.g. data, values, etc.)


### 1. **Add parameters** 

Set parameters in the header as subvalues of `params`

```yaml
---
title: Reproducible Country Report
author: Agnes and Teteh
date: 30/07/2020
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: cosmo
    highlight: haddock
    number_sections: TRUE
    toc: TRUE
*params:
*  country: Colombia
---
```
???

Parameters allow you to reuse your document with new inputs such as data and values. 

We set parameters in the YAML header as subvalues of params. 
Remember that subvalues need to be indented as the parameter for country is, country: Colombia. 

---
# Parameters revisited

**Parameters** allow you to reuse your document with new inputs (e.g. data, values, etc.)


### 2. **Call parameters** 

Parameters values are called in the code as `params$<name>`.

* How many times is `params$country` used in the code?

* Where does it appear?

`r countdown(minutes = 3, seconds = 00)` 

???

Answer:

The answer should be 7. It is used to subset the data, and also to change the name as it appear in the text, plots, table, and headings. 


---
# Parameters revisited

**Parameters** allow you to reuse your document with new inputs (e.g. data, values, etc.)


### 3. **Set parameters** 

Set values with "knit with parameters" or the params argument of `render()`.

More about `render()` soon!

Let's try rerunning the report for **Paraguay**.

???

We can set values by clicking knit -> knit with parameters, or using the params argument of the render function. More on the render function soon. #

Let's rerun the report for Paraguay

---

# But what about Cambodia?

```{r Creating the life expectancy table Cambodia, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Country of Interest
gapminder_country <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Cambodia",
         year > 1980 & year <= 2010)

# Wider Continent
gapminder_continent <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Americas",
         year > 1980 & year <= 2010)

# Whole world
gapminder_sub <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year > 1980 & year <= 2010)

lifeExp_country <- gapminder_continent %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp))

lifeExp_country %>% 
  kable(booktabs = T,
        caption = "Mean Life Expectancy in the Americas") %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  row_spec(which(lifeExp_country$country == "Cambodia"), bold = T, color = "white", background = "blue")


```

???

Agnes and Teteh have run into a problem. They've received a request for a country report from Cambodia, but when they rerun the report, they still get a table of the Americas and Cambodia isn't there?

We need to help them parameterize the report for different continents!

---
# Your Turn

* Add a parameter for continent.

--

* Replace the mentions of **Americas** with your new parameter.

--

* Hint look at how the parameter for country is specified.



`r countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 00)` 

???

When thinking about parameters think about what changes. If someone asked you to change the report, where you would need to alter your code if someone asked you for a specific time period, place, or to filter for certain values? This will help you guide where to place parameters and as you adapt your report.
 
---
# Nearly there

```{r Prepping Country example for Cambodia, echo = FALSE}

# Country of Interest

```{r Prepping the data for the life expectancy table Cambodia, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}


# Summarising the mean life expectancy to plot
lifeExp_country <- gapminder_continent %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp))

lifeExp_country %>% 
  kable(booktabs = T,
        caption = "Mean Life Expectancy in the Americas") %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  row_spec(which(lifeExp_country$country == "Cambodia"), bold = T, color = "white", background = "blue")
```

???

We've update instance of "Americas" in the code. But what about for the names of the table?

# Using paste() to update names

`paste("Life Expectancy over time in",
      params$country,
      "from 1980 to 2010",
      sep = " ")`
    

* Run `?paste` to see the help file. What does `sep` do?
* Update the table code to get the correct continent name.


`r countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 00)` 

--

* We're now in line with `Country_Report_Step3_4.Rmd`

???

paste is a useful function that allows us combine vectors, text, and other values into a character string. 

sep is a character or character string to separate the terms. In this case we use a space " ", but we could also specify a comma "," in other circumstances depending on the character string we would like.

# What about our title? and the date?

* To change the YAML header title you would call inline R code using the syntax *'r '*.

--

* Date will take a slightly different format: 'r format(Sys.Date(), '%d %B %Y')'

* '?strptime' includes a short guide to POSIX standard to change format of your date.

```yaml
---
title: "'r paste('Life Expectancy in ', params$country)'" 
_author: Agnes and Teteh
date: "'r format(Sys.Date(), '%d %B %Y')'"
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: cosmo
    highlight: haddock
    number_sections: TRUE
    toc: TRUE
params:
  country: Colombia
---
```

* What would we want to change %d to to get the full weekday name?

--

* We're now in line with `Country_Report_Step5.Rmd`

???

We will need to use inline R code to update our YAML header. To get today's date we can also use the function Sys.Date() to get the date for our system.

Running ?strptime will give a short guide to the POSIX standard. Looking at the helpful we can see that %d gives us the day of the month as a decimal number. What would we want to change %d to if we wanted to get the full weekday name? Answer: %A

# Creating multiple files using `render()`

* All our changes are captured in `Country_Report_Final.Rmd`

--

* Use `rmarkdown::render()` to render/knit at the command line or console.

**Key arguments**

* **input** file to render
* **output_format**: the output format
* **output_options**: list of render options
* **output_file**: name of output file
* **params**: list of params to use.

???

Now that we've helped Agnes and Teteh parameterize their report, we can use the render function from the rmarkdown, rmarkdown::render(), to create the new report. There are different arguments we can specify: 

* **input** file to render
* **output_format**: the output format
* **output_options**: list of render options
* **output_file**: name of output file
* **params**: list of params to use.

---
# Creating multiple files using `render()`

* Asking for the parameters:
```{r, eval = FALSE}

rmarkdown::render(input = "Country_Report_Final.Rmd", 
                  output_file = "newreports/Jamaica_CountryReport.html", 
                  params = "ask")

```

--
* Providing the parameters in a list:
```{r, eval = FALSE}

rmarkdown::render(input = "Country_Report_Final.Rmd", 
                  output_file = "Jamaica_CountryReport.html", 
                  params = list(country = "Jamaica", continent = "Americas"))

```

???

There are a couple options we can try when using the render function. We can have it ask for the parameters or we can provide the parameters as a list.

Rendering each report one by one may work in some cases, but if we want to render multiple reports we could use a for loop. Where for each set of parameters e.g. Jamaica, Americas; India, Asia; Cote d'Ivoire, Africa, we generate a report.  

---

# Generating multiple reports using for loops

* Open `render_report.R`

```{r report countries, eval = FALSE}

report_countries <- data.frame(country = c("Bulgaria", "Burkina Faso", "Cambodia", "Cameroon", "Canada"), 
                               continent = c("Europe", "Africa", "Asia", "Africa", "Americas"), 
                               stringsAsFactors = FALSE)


for (i in 1:nrow(report_countries)){

rmarkdown::render(input = "Country_Report_Final.Rmd", 
                  output_file = paste0("new_reports/",report_countries[i, "country"],"_Country_Report.html"),
                  params = list(country = report_countries[i, "country"],
                                continent = report_countries[i, "continent"]))

}  

```

???

Here's an example of using a for loop in practice. We first define a new data frame where we store our parameter combinations for country and continent.

Next, we run a for loop for each country, continent combination. Notice that we use the paste function here so that the file names will also change. We don't want to add a space so we use paste0.  

For Instructors:
Note, you will want to make sure that the working directory is set to the location of render_report.R. This can be done through the menus: Session -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location
