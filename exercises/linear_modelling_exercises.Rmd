# Import the libraries

# Exploratory Data Analysis


## Read in the data

```{r salaries}

salaries <- read_csv("../data/faculty-data.csv")

salaries <- salaries %>%
              mutate(department = as_factor(department))

```

## Explore the data

* What are the variables in our data set?

```{r}

head(salaries)

```

* How many departments are in the data? How many employees are in each department?

```{r}

summary(salaries)

```

Using `View()`, what does each row in the data.frame represent?

```{r}



```

* What's the difference between a continuous and a categorical (factor or discrete) variable?

**Hint:** Country is a categorical variable, Height is a continous variable

### Plotting the data

* Plotting a single continuous variable


```{r}

ggplot(data = salaries) +
   geom_density(aes(salary), fill = "blue")
  

```

* Plotting a single categorical variable

```{r}

ggplot(data = salaries) +
   geom_bar(aes(x = department, fill = department)) +
   labs(x = "Department", y = "# Staff", fill = "Department")
  

```

* Relationships between two continuous variables

```{r}

ggplot(data = salaries) +
  geom_point(aes(x = experience, y = salary))

```

* Relationships between a discrete and continous variable

```{r}

ggplot(data = salaries) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = department, y = salary, color = department))

```

```{r}

ggplot(data = salaries) +
  geom_violin(aes(x = department, y = salary, fill = department))

```

* Looking at the plot, which departments have the highest salaries? Do you think the departments are very different from one another?

# Constructing a linear model


## The relationship between salary and experience is the same across all departments.

Each department has the same starting salary and the same increase in salary with experience.

### Exercise:

* What are our response and explanatory variables in this case?


```{r}

m1 <- lm(salary ~ experience, data = salaries)

```

```{r}
summary(m1)
```


* **Intercept interpretation:** the starting salary is 62154 USD.

* **Slope interpretation:** with every year of experience an employee's salary increases by 683.5 USD. 
* Overall the model is a poor fit, with only 0.01235 percent of the variation explained by the model as shown by the Adjusted R-squared.


* Plotting the fitted model

```{r}

m1_results <- broom::augment(m1)


head(m1_results)
```

## Residuals

What are residuals? How are they used to determine the best fit?

```{r}


ggplot(data = m1_results,
       aes(x = experience, y = salary)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = experience, yend = .fitted), color = "red", size = 0.3)


```

## The four assumptions of the linear model:

1. **Linearity** - The relationship between the explanatory variable ($X$) and the response variable ($Y$) must be linear.

2. **Normality**- The residual must be approximately normally distributed.

3. **Homoscedasticity**- The residuals are should have a constant variance.

4. **Independence**- There should be no relationship between the residuals and the response variable ($Y$).


```{r}

plot(m1)

```

## Each department has a different starting salary but the increase in salary with experience is the same.

Our data is "nested", that is we have groups within our data. We can add group, the department, as a third variable as the colour.

```{r}

ggplot(data = salaries) +
  geom_point(aes(x = experience, y = salary, color = department)) +
  labs(x="Experience", y="Salary") +
  scale_colour_discrete('Department')

```

* How does the formula change if we think each group may have a different starting salary?

```{r}
m2  <- lm(salary ~ experience + department, data = salaries)

```

```{r}

m2_results <- broom::augment(m2)

ggplot(data = m2_results, 
       aes(x = experience, y = salary, colour = department)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="Experience", y="Salary") +
  scale_colour_discrete('Department') +
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted), size = 1)

```
* Let's take a look again at those residuals

```{r}

ggplot(data = m2_results, 
       aes(x = experience, y = salary, colour = department)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="Experience", y="Salary") +
  scale_colour_discrete('Department') +
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted), size = 1) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = experience, yend = .fitted, colour = department), size = 0.3, linetype = 2)

```

```{r}
summary(m2)

```

* Let's inspect the residual plots again

```{r}

plot(m2)

```

If someone works in a department for 6 years, will they have a higher salary if they are in the biology or sociology department?

* Let's extract the residuals using `coef`

```{r}

m2_coef <- coef(m2)

names(m2_coef)

```

```{r}

biology_ex6 <- m2_coef["(Intercept)"] + m2_coef["departmentbiology"] + 6*m2_coef["experience"] 


sociology_ex6 <- m2_coef["(Intercept)"] + 6*m2_coef["experience"] 


```

```{r}

m2_results <- broom::augment(m2)

ggplot(data = m2_results, 
       aes(x = experience, y = salary, colour = department)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="Experience", y="Salary") +
  scale_colour_discrete('Department') +
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted), size = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(x = 6, y = biology_ex6), color = "black") +
  geom_point(aes(x = 6, y = sociology_ex6), color = "black")


```

## Each department has different starting salaries and salaries increase at different rates.


```{r}

m3 <- lm(salary ~ experience*department, data = salaries)

m3_results <- broom::augment(m3)

```

```{r}

ggplot(data = m3_results, 
       aes(x = experience, y = salary, color = department)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="Experience", y="Salary") +
  scale_colour_discrete('Department') +
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted), size = 1)

```

* Plot with the residuals


```{r}

ggplot(data = m3_results, 
       aes(x = experience, y = salary, color = department)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Experience", y = "Salary") +
  scale_colour_discrete('Department') +
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted), size = 1) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = experience, yend = .fitted, colour = department), size = 0.3, linetype = 2)
  


```

* Summary of the model


```{r}

summary(m3)

```




### Exercises


* Create the four model diagnostic plots. What do you make of the plots?

```{r}



```


* What is the predicted salary with 7 years of experience in Biology?


```{r}

m3_coefs <- coef(m3)


```

```{r}

## Biology

biology_ex7 <- m3_coefs["(Intercept)"] + m3_coefs["departmentbiology"] + 7*(m3_coefs["experience:departmentbiology"] + m3_coefs["experience"])


```

### Exercise:

What is the predicted salary for someone with 7 years of experience Sociology?


```{r, eval = FALSE}

sociology_ex7

```

### Exercise:

Try plotting both salaries after 7 years on the graph.


```{r, eval = FALSE}

ggplot(data = m3_results, 
       aes(x = experience, y = salary, colour = `as.factor(department)`)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="Experience", y="Salary") +
  scale_colour_discrete('Department') +
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted), size = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(x = ______, y = ______), color = "black") +
  geom_point(aes(x = _____, y = ______), color = "black")

```

### Exercise

* Let's visualise the coefficients

```{r}

GGally::ggcoef(m3)

```


* Which department get the highest raises (biggest slope)?

```{r}

biology_slope <- m3_coefs["experience:departmentbiology"] + m3_coefs["experience"]


```

* Which department has the highest starting salary (biggest intercept)?

```{r, echo = FALSE}

biology_intercept <- m3_coefs["(Intercept)"] + m3_coefs["departmentbiology"]

```


# Comparing the models

* Which model has the best fit?

```{r}

broom::glance(m1)
broom::glance(m2)
broom::glance(m3)


```
