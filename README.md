# You

* Are familiar with R. 

* Are new to linear modelling or haven't covered it in a while.

* Are new to linear modelling in R.

# Packages and requirements

* For this adventure you'll need the `tidyverse` meta-package, `broom` to tidy our models, and `GGally` to plot our coefficients.

# Learning Objectives

In this course we explore linear models and their capabilities using a simulated dataset on salaries from different University departments.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

*  What is the difference between a continuous and categorical variable?

*  What is variation and covariation?

*  Where does Exploratory Data Analysis fit in with analysis?

*  How to use plots to explore variation in 
    *	A continuous variable
    *	A categorical variable

* How to use plots to explore covariation between
    *	Two continuous variables
    *	A categorical and continuous variable.

## Model Basics and Construction

* What is a model family and fitted model?

* What is the difference between a response and an explanatory variable?

* How to construct a linear model in R.

* What are the slope and intercept in a linear model?

* Picking out key information from the model table

* How to extract specific parameters from the model object

## Assessing Model Fit

* How to pick out key information from the table from a fitted model.

* How to inspect model residuals to assess model fit.

* How to use Adjusted R-squared and AIC to compare models.

# Slides and Exercises
